# Interactive component

For the interactive component, I build a d3 object where the over-reporting rate can be compared across years. In the main results sections I avoided presenting multiple identical plots that varied only in time, and aggregated all data points across years, with the exception of the map plots. The assumption there was that the aggregate pattern would be representative of the overall pattern. We won't know if that assumption holds, unless we can verify this to be true. To illustrate the point, I create a plot that compares over-reporting by gender. The user can choose the year to view. The default data is from 2008.

There are two ways of presenting this data: (1) holding the scale constant, (2) varying the scale depending on the values of the data. My visualization does (2). The advantage of this is that the maximum value of the y scale is determined by the maximum y value in the data. In other words, the focus of the visualization is on the difference between Female and Male. Of course, an attentive audience can also take note of the changing overall levels of over-reporting. On the other hand, had I done (1), it would be easier to spot the changes in overall levels (for both Female and Male), but harder to see the difference between the two, especially if they are marginal. In this case, the gender plot shows that overall levels of overreporting are higher in years 2012 and 2016 compared to 2008. The gap between Female and Male increased in 2012, but returns to similar levels in 2016. It's not clear what explains this difference, and it's possible that the difference is statistically not significant. This of course would be a subject of further analysis.
