# Interactive component

For the interactive component, I build a d3 object where the over-reporting rate can be compared across years. In the main results sections I mainly avoided the issue of presenting data over time and aggregated all data points across years. The assumption there was that the aggregate pattern would be representative of the overall pattern. We won't know if that assumption holds, unless we can verify this to be true. To illustrate the point, I create a plot that compares over-reporting by gender. The user can choose the year to view. The default data is from 2008.
