# Conclusion

The main limitations of this project--related to the fact that we cannot distinguish between administrative errors and lies--were discussed at the outset. Despite this challenge, it is possible, at least for variables that I examined, to identify a few patterns that predict over-reporting.

It would be interesting, time permitting, to look at additional political variables, such as margins of the elections, which party won, etc. to see if these electoral outcomes also have an effect on overreporting. The issue here would be that electoral outcome would be identical for all respondents within the administrative units (i.e. state, congressional district (CD)), and given that many states constantly vote for the same party, there may not be sufficient variation in electoral outcomes at state level (although more variation would be seen at CD level) with data from only 3 years.

The main challenge I faced writing up the results was figuring out how to communicate the "findings." In statistics courses we often speak in terms of p-values and significance, and with visualization, as we have learned, scales can really make a difference in what is a "clear pattern" or "noticeable difference."
