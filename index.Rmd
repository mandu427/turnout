# Introduction

test: modified
List three questions that you hope you will be able to answer from your research. (It's ok if these change as your work progresses.)


I am interested in exploring the phenomenon of over-reporting of turnout in elections in surveys. The main dataset I use to investigate this is the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/), which asks respondents whether they voted in the recent election. The data includes a variable which indicates whether there is a matching voting record for the respondent. One way to investigate factors that may explain over-reporting is to look at observations for whom there is no record of voting, and see who responded by saying that they did not vote (record matches response) and compare them to those who claim to have voted, even though there is no corresponding record of them having done so. For those who claim to have voted, there are two possible explanations for the missing record.  First, it may have been an administrative error. Alternatively, the respondent may not be telling the truth. In this final project, I will see if the share of those who claim to have voted vs. not differ by a number of parameters described below.

- a) state (proxies political climate)
- b) age; income; race; political affiliation; strength of partisanship (demographic variables)
- c) how long Rs have lived at the current address; frequency church attendance (ties to community)
- d) by election cycle; general election including presidential vs. off yr etc. (election specific variables)
- e) turnout; margin of elections (This data will come from the MIT Elections Data) (if time allows)
